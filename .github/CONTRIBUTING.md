Here are few short advices before you open new issue.

1. Please open one issue per problem/suggestion/bug/etc. It made easier to
   discuss issue.
2. Try to bring as much as possible informations about issue. It is probably
   impossible to give too much informations :) Generally, when you want to add
   something to the bundle, try describe it as detailed as possible, when you
   want to report a bug, try to give enough informations to reproduce bug by
   the others.
3. Please, before you open new issue, check if someone earlier didn't created
   that same or similar issue (by using search option).
4. If you want to suggest a new plugin which should be added to the bundle,
   just add it in the project wiki on [Recommended plugins](https://github.com/thindil/vim-ada/wiki/Recommended-plugins)
