1. General Information     						                 *vimada-general*

Vim-Ada is ready to deploy set of plugins and settings which helps write
programs in various languages. As name of bundle says, it is focused mainly on
Ada programming language, but it have support for other programming languages
too.

All changes to plugins are under respective plugin license which can be found
in plugins directory. If plugin don't have license info included, then all my
changes are in public domain.

If you are new to Vim and want to have more user friendly experience with this
editor, I recommend to use SpaceVim. Main differences between vim-ada and
SpaceVim:
- Design in Keep It Simple Stupid principle: Vim-ada is just a bundle of
  plugins which can be easily added, removed or locally edited to suit your
  needs.
- No changes to core systems of Vim: All keyboard shortcuts are that same,
  thus, Vim-ada require less learning for experienced Vim/NeoVim users.
- Easy to deploy: just download configuration file and replace your config,
  rest will be done after first start of Vim/NeoVim.
- Much younger, less polished than SpaceVim.

==============================================================================
2. Adding or removing plugins in the bundle					     *vimada-plugins*

To adding or removing Vim/NeoVim plugins Vim-Ada uses Plug plugin. Please
refer to its documentation by :help plug
Additional information:
- Vim-ada should be always loaded as first plugin. Especially if others
  plugins have any local changes. All others plugins can be loaded in any
  order.
- If you remove Vim-ada plugin or Plug all bundle will stop working.

==============================================================================
3. Adding or removing local changes to the plugins              *vimada-local*

Generally, vim-ada uses command "git apply" to add local changes to plugins,
thus please refer to this command documentation for information and limitations
of it.

To add local changes to selected plugin you have to follow this steps:
1. Create file [name-of-plugin].diff with "git diff" command
2. Copy that file to vim-ada/patches directory
3. In Vim/NeoVim run command :PlugUpdate! to apply patch to it.

Thus, for example, creating local changes patch for Syntastic plugin could
looks that:
1. git diff > syntastic.diff
2. cp syntastic.diff ../vim-ada/patches
3. In Vim/NeoVim run command :PlugUpdate!

To remove local changes from selected plugin, use Vim/NeoVim command
RemoveLocalChanges[!] [pluginname] where [pluginname] is name of the plugin
which will be have removed all local changes. If bang is added to the
command (RemoveLocalChanges!), it will remove .diff file with local changes
too.

Thus, for example, removing local changes patch for Syntastic plugin could
looks that:
:RemoveLocalChanges syntastic
If you want remove file with local changes too:
:RemoveLocalChanges! syntastic
