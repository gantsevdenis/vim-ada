1. General Information                                        *vimada-general*

Vim-Ada is ready to deploy set of plugins and settings which helps write
programs in various programming languages. As name of bundle says, it is
focused mainly on the Ada programming language, but it has support for other
programming languages too.

All changes to the plugins are under respective plugin license which can be
found in plugins directory. If a plugin don't have a license info included,
then all my changes are in public domain.

If you are new to Vim/NeoVim and you want to have a more user-friendly
experience with this editor, I recommend to use SpaceVim. Main differences
between vim-ada and SpaceVim:
* Design in "Keep It Simple Stupid" principle: Vim-ada is just a bundle of
  plugins which can be easily added, removed or locally edited to suit your
  needs.
* No changes to core systems of Vim: All keyboard shortcuts are that same,
  thus, Vim-ada require less learning for experienced Vim/NeoVim users.
* Easy to deploy: just download configuration file and replace your config,
  rest will be done after first start of Vim/NeoVim.
* Much younger, less polished than SpaceVim.

==============================================================================
2. Adding or removing plugins in the bundle                   *vimada-plugins*

To adding or removing Vim/NeoVim plugins Vim-Ada uses Plug plugin. Please
refer to its documentation by :help plug
Additional information:
* Vim-ada should be always loaded as first plugin. Especially if others
  plugins have any local changes. All others plugins can be loaded in any
  order.
* If you remove Vim-ada plugin or Plug all bundle will stop working.

==============================================================================
3. Adding or removing local changes to the plugins              *vimada-local*

Generally, vim-ada uses command "git apply" to add local changes to plugins,
thus please refer to this command documentation for information and limitations
of it.

To add local changes to selected plugin you have to follow this steps:
1. Create file [name-of-plugin].diff with "git diff" command
2. Copy that file to vim-ada/patches directory
3. In Vim/NeoVim run command :AppendLocalChanges [name-of-plugin] to apply
   patch to it.

Thus, for example, creating local changes patch for Syntastic plugin could
look that:
1. git diff > syntastic.diff
2. cp syntastic.diff ../vim-ada/patches
3. In Vim/NeoVim run command :AppendLocalChanges syntastic

To remove local changes from selected plugin, use Vim/NeoVim command
RemoveLocalChanges[!] [pluginname] where [pluginname] is name of the plugin
which will be having removed all local changes. If bang is added to the
command (RemoveLocalChanges!), it will remove .diff file with local changes
too.

Thus, for example, removing local changes patch for Syntastic plugin could
look that:
:RemoveLocalChanges syntastic
If you want to remove file with local changes too:
:RemoveLocalChanges! syntastic

4. Frequently Asked Questions                                     *vimada-faq*

Question: Vim-Plug don't want to update plugin with local changes.
Answer: Unfortunately, Vim-Plug don't have option to run something before
        update starts (only after it). Thus, in that situation, local changes
        must be removed manually from that plugin before upgrade it. To do
        it, run Vim/NeoVim command RemoveLocalChanges [pluginname] and then
        run upgrade process again.

Question: Where I can find more plugins?
Answer: You can look at the project wiki page:
        https://github.com/thindil/vim-ada/wiki/Recommended-plugins
        or at Vim Awesome page:
        https://vimawesome.com/

Question: I have question not listed here.
Answer: You can ask it at mail thindil@laeran.pl or open a new issue at Github
        project page: https://github.com/thindil/vim-ada/issues
        But in second case, please first use search option to check if someone
        not asked same or similar question earlier.
